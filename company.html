            <p class="section-content">
                Companies can buy Green Credits from platforms like Ekopay to offset their carbon emissions. These credits are generated by projects that reduce greenhouse gases, such as renewable energy initiatives or reforestation programs. Companies with surplus Green Credits can list them for sale on the platform, providing an opportunity for others to purchase and meet their sustainability goals. The buying and selling process is transparent, ensuring a fair price for both parties.
